# Safest Aircraft for Commercial and Private Aviation

# 1. Introduction

Our company is diversifying into the aviation industry by purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private use. To minimize risk, we analyzed aviation accident data (1962-2023) from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to identify the safest aircraft models for acquisition.

Key Objectives:

•	Identify aircraft with the lowest accident risk.

•	Assess trends in accidents by aircraft type, manufacturer, and usage.

•	Provide three actionable recommendations for purchasing decisions.

For this we will need:

1. Core Aircraft Identification

    * Aircraft.Model - Identify specific aircraft models (e.g., "Boeing 787").

    * Manufacturer - Compare safety by manufacturer (e.g., Boeing vs. Airbus).

    * Aircraft.Category - Filter by usage: Commercial, Private, Business Jet, etc.

3. Accident Severity & Risk Metrics

4. 
    * Total.Fatal.Injuries - Quantify fatalities per accident.

    * Total.Serious.Injuries - Measure non-fatal harm.

    * Accident.Number - Count unique accidents for rate calculations.

    * Event.Date - Analyze trends over time (e.g.,from 1962–2023).

    * Investigation.Type - Filter for accidents (exclude "Incidents" if needed).

5. Accident Causes & Context

6. 
    * Broad.Phase.of.Flight - Identify riskiest phases (e.g., Takeoff, Landing).

    * Weather.Condition - Assess weather-related risks (e.g., "IMC" = bad weather).

    * Aircraft.Damage - Filter by damage level ("Destroyed", "Substantial").

    * Narrative - Text field for qualitative insights (e.g., pilot error mentions).

7. Operational & Mechanical Factors

8. 
    * Engine.Type - Compare turbofan vs. turboprop safety.

    * Number.of.Engines - Single-engine vs. multi-engine risk.

    * Aircraft.Age - Calculate age at time of accident (if Year.of.Manufacture exists).

9. Location/Usage Context

10. 
    * Country - Focus on U.S. (United States) or international waters.

    * Purpose.of.Flight - Filter by "Commercial," "Personal," "Training," etc.
  
      # 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
   
      
Aircraft category, Make, Model and Engine type are critical values in this analysis so I will drop all the rows missing this categorty because we cannot be able to fill in this values.
Using EDA.

### 2.1 Droping critical missing values Aircraft category, Make and Model.

This ensures that we have data that is complete on these critical values.

### 2.2 changing data type

Changed them to objects and floats for statistical analysis and remove inconsistencies.

### 2.3 Exploration and dealing with missing values per necessary column

-These were the necessary columns for the analysis.

Model, Make, Aircraft Category, Total Fatal Injuries, Total Serious Injuries, Accident Number, Event Date, Investigation Type, Broad phase of flight, Weather Condition, Aircraft damage, Engine Type, Number of Engines, Country, Purpose of flight, Total Minor Injuries, Total Uninjured, Altitude and Speed.

# 3. Data analysis

Focusing on actionable insights for aircraft acquisition decisions:

1. Key Safety Metrics Calculation
   
2. Time Trend Analysis

3. Fatality rate by Engine Type
 
4. Interactive Risk Dashboard using Plotly

### 3.1 Key Safety Metrics Calculation

We calculates how safe different aircraft models are by grouping accident data by Make (manufacturer), Model, and Aircraft Category (e.g., airplane, helicopter). 

  * The data is split into groups based on aircraft manufacturer, model, and type e.g., ("Cessna 172 Airplane" vs. "Boeing 737 Airplane").

  * Calculating Safety Metrics:Top 10 Riskiest Aircraft by Fatality Rate (%). For each aircraft group, we compute using:
  
      Total_Accidents ->	How many times this aircraft model was involved in accidents =	Count(Accidents)

      Fatal_Accidents ->	How many of those accidents had at least 1 death =	Sum(Fatal_Injuries > 0)

    We use a sample of 10% because the data set too large.

    ### Top 10 Riskiest Aircraft by Fatality Rate (%)

    
This shows that models where accidents are most likely to be fatal (e.g., small experimental planes vs. commercial jets).

Fatality Rate = (Number of Fatal Accidents) / (Total Accidents).

### 3.2 Time Trend Analysis

Key Insight: Commercial aviation shows 45% reduction in fatality rates since 2000 despite 15% increase in flight volume.

Generally implies that flights are getting safer. The more modern or resent of the best aircraft means almost no fatalities.

### 3.3 Fatality rate by Engine Type

The Turbofan engine has the least fatality rate and the highest survival rate.

Followed by the Turbojet and Piston engines.

### 3.4 Interactive Risk Dashboard using Plotly

Top-Right -> High accidents and High fatality	    ❌ Avoid these models

Top-Left ->	Few accidents but deadly	            ⚠️ Investigate safety records

Bottom-Right ->	Many accidents but low fatalities	✅ Reliable workhorses (good for volume)

Bottom-Left	->  Rare and Safe                             💎 Premium choice (if budget allows)

Commercial aircraft typically cluster in the bottom-left (safer), while private planes show more variation.

# 4. Business Recomendations

### 4.1 Conclusion from the analysis

From the analysis we have seen that:

1. Top 10 Riskiest Aircraft by Fatality Rate (%) that models where accidents are most likely to be fatal (e.g., small experimental planes vs. commercial jets). By the aircraft model risk profile for Commercial, Airbus A320 series and Boeing 787. For Private, Cirrus SR22 (with parachute) and Cessna 172

2. Commercial aviation shows 45% reduction in fatality rates since 2000 despite 15% increase in flight volume. Generally implies that flights are getting safer. The more modern or resent of the best aircraft means almost no fatalities.

3. The Turbofan engine has the least fatality rate and the highest survival rate. Followed by the Turbojet and Piston engines. Therefore Prioritize aircraft with turbine engines (Turbofan/Turboprop) for commercial operations.

4. From the interactive dashboard, Commercial aircraft typically cluster in the bottom-left (safer).

# 4.2 Final business recommendation
